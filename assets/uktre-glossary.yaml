      *Research consent* is the process of documenting an individual's choice to be involved in a research project(s) and typically called informed consent - this conveys that there is a process to allow participants to make a meaningful choiceInformed consent" is used to emphasise that understanding is crucial before agreeing, and typically applies when sharing personal data or participating in research studies. Research consent is commonly required for participation in clinical trials/research.
      *Broad consent* is a mechanism of gaining the consent of an individual who donates their biosamples and health data with a view to their future use in research, and may not be specific to a particular research project at the time of collection.
      *Assent* is the process of providing approval for data processing/involvement in research by an individual who is not legally eligible to do so (e.g. a child under the age of 16), and will be supported by an adult providing legal consent.
      *Withdrawal of consent* is both a legal and ethical right of the individual whose data is being processed, and must be respected in reference to data protection and research compliance. It allows an infividual to discontinue/rescind access to his/her data and prevent further processing.

The raw patient data would never leave each hospital, but researchers could still draw insights from the combined statistical findings across all participating hospitals.

      A model of data access in which different organizations keep full control of their own data but agree on ways to safely share access to it for specific purposes. Each organization maintains its own data security and rules, but allows approved users to work with the data through agreed-upon tools and systems. For example, research institutions might share access to their datasets while keeping the data within their own secure environments, allowing collaborative research without moving sensitive data to a central location.

      - Identifiability
    definition: |-
      Data that can be used to identify, contact, or locate a specific individual, either by itself or when combined with other available information. This includes direct identifiers like full names, NHS numbers, and email addresses; indirect identifiers such as date of birth or workplace that could identify someone when combined; and context-dependent identifiers like IP addresses or device IDs. For example, while a person's age alone might not identify them, combining it with their job title and city of residence could make them identifiable – such as "a 45-year-old pediatric surgeon in Bolton, Greater Manchester" might be specific enough to identify a particular individual, even without naming them directly. This type of data requires special handling under various privacy regulations like GDPR to protect individuals' privacy and prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

    definition: |-
      A computer programming technique particularly suited to identifying patterns or rules in large amounts of data. Rather than beginning with a fixed set of rules, an ML program builds up  ("learns") a set of likely rules by processing many example datasets (this stage of ML is known as "training"). When the set of likely rules is complete, the ML program can apply them to new datasets and offer a likely prediction (this stage is known as "inference").
      For example: an ML program trained to recognise car numberplates would be trained on many pictures of car numberplates, building up a set of likely rules that will enable to program to "recognise" car numberplates in the future.

But if someone doesn't want their private information to be shared, they can choose to opt-out using the National Data Opt-out; their personal information remains exclusively for their medical care.
  - term: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    tags:
      - Analysis
    definition: |-
      A field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computer software to analyse, interpret, and generate human language. NLP allows machines to extract meaningful information from text, identify key details, uncover patterns, and detect trends within large volumes of text data, but faces challenges because words can have different meanings depending on their context, and the software cannot understand emotions or the intentions behind why certain words were chosen. Examples of NLP in the TRE space include: identifying symptoms, diagnoses and treatments in electronic health records; identifying references to mental health concerns such as suicidial thoughts, self-harm, or changes in mode from clinicians notes; and programs to automatically identify patients based on eligibility criteria for research studies or clinical trials, employment history or status over time, or students' academic progression over time.
